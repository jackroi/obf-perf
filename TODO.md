# TODO

- Probably remove psutil from requirements.txt
- Maybe split table if too big (and thus also transposing it)
- Find a way to write the unit of measurement (probably in the name column)
- Sort results in a nice way
- Execute non obfuscated version
- Compute some code metrics using tigress SoftwareMetrics transformation

- Probably unify sorting function across several files with a single name `sort`
 (so can target just that with obfuscation)

- Maybe a flag to use the gcc -O3 optimization
